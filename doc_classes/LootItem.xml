		Resource representing a single item entry in a loot table with weight and amount ranges.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The LootItem resource represents an individual entry in a [Loot] table. It defines which item can be generated, its probability weight relative to other items in the same loot table, and the range of amounts that can be generated.
		
		Higher weight values make the item more likely to be selected during random generation. The min_amount and max_amount define the range for random quantity generation when this item is selected.

		<member name="item_id" type="String" setter="set_item_id" getter="get_item_id" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The ID of the item that this loot entry represents. This should correspond to an [ItemDefinition] ID in the [InventoryDatabase].
		</member>
		<member name="max_amount" type="int" setter="set_max_amount" getter="get_max_amount" default="1">
			The maximum amount of this item that can be generated when this loot entry is selected. The actual amount will be randomly chosen between [member min_amount] and this value (inclusive).
		</member>
		<member name="min_amount" type="int" setter="set_min_amount" getter="get_min_amount" default="1">
			The minimum amount of this item that will be generated when this loot entry is selected. The actual amount will be randomly chosen between this value and [member max_amount] (inclusive).
		</member>
		<member name="weight" type="float" setter="set_weight" getter="get_weight" default="1.0">
			The probability weight of this loot item relative to other items in the same [Loot] table. Higher values increase the chance of this item being selected. For example, an item with weight 10.0 is twice as likely to be selected as an item with weight 5.0.
